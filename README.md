# Module-Eight-Journal
The Gaming Room is a company that wants to grow its popular online game, Draw It or Lose It, so that players can enjoy it on different platforms. As a Technology Consultant at Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), my role is to help the client understand how to make this expansion possible. 

1. The Client and Software Requirements
Client: The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand its game “Draw It or Lose It.”
Goal: Develop a web-based, cross-platform version of the game to reach users on iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.
Key Requirements:
  Multiplayer functionality with unique team and game names.
  Only one active game instance in memory at a time.
  Scalable, cloud-ready architecture.
  Secure communication and user data protection.
  Consistent player experience across platforms.

2. What I Did Well
I provided a clear, detailed explanation of system architecture and constraints.
The recommendations section clearly connected platform features (like Windows APIs, memory, and storage management) to the client’s real needs.
I showed a good understanding of cross-platform development, scalability, and cost management.

3. What Helped During the Design Process
Working through the design document helped me think before coding — breaking the project into clear parts like architecture, memory, and network design.
It made it easier to understand how different systems interact and how requirements shape the final software.

4. What I Would Revise
I would improve the Evaluation and Recommendation sections by comparing multiple platforms in more detail (Linux, Windows, macOS).
I’d also include more about security — for example, encryption methods or authentication strategies.
Adding visual diagrams for architecture and data flow would make the document easier to follow.

5. Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the client’s needs by focusing on cross-platform support, scalability, and cost efficiency.
Translating these into design meant recommending a web-based, responsive interface and scalable backend architecture.
Considering user needs ensures the final product is usable, reliable, and enjoyable — which builds trust and long-term engagement.

6. Approach to Software Design
I started by analyzing the requirements and constraints, then matched them with system capabilities.
Used object-oriented principles (inheritance, encapsulation) to model relationships between game, player, and team.
For future projects, I would:
  Use UML diagrams early to map relationships.

Employ agile methods for iterative improvements.

Focus on reusability and scalability through modular code and containerized environments.
